#Project Overview
Provide a brief overview of the project, explaining its purpose and high-level functionality.

DAG Structure
Explain the structure of the DAG and its main components.

DAG Name: weather_dag_2
Start Date: January 8, 2023
Schedule Interval: Daily
Owner: airflow
Tasks
List and describe each task within the DAG, including its purpose and dependencies.

tsk_start:

Task Type: DummyOperator
Purpose: Dummy task to mark the start of the DAG.
group_a:

Task Type: TaskGroup

Purpose: Group of tasks for extracting data from S3 and a weather API.

tsk_create_table_1:

Purpose: Create a lookup table for city information.
tsk_truncate_table:

Purpose: Truncate the lookup table to prepare for data upload.
tsk_uploadS3_to_postgres:

Purpose: Upload city lookup data from S3 to PostgreSQL.
tsk_create_table_2:

Purpose: Create a table for storing weather data.
tsk_is_chennai_weather_api_ready:

Purpose: Check if the weather API for Chennai is ready.
tsk_extract_chennai_weather_data:

Purpose: Extract weather data for Chennai from the API.
transform_load_chennai_weather_data:

Purpose: Transform and load Chennai weather data into a CSV file.
tsk_load_weather_data:

Purpose: Load transformed weather data from the CSV file into PostgreSQL.
task_join_data:

Task Type: PostgresOperator
Purpose: Join weather data with additional city information from PostgreSQL.
task_load_joined_data:

Task Type: PythonOperator
Purpose: Save the joined data to an S3 bucket.
task_end_pipeline:

Task Type: DummyOperator
Purpose: Dummy task to mark the end of the DAG.
Dependencies
Explain the dependencies between tasks and any external dependencies such as connections or sensors.

tsk_start depends on nothing and is the starting point.
group_a tasks have dependencies within the group and on external sensors.
task_join_data depends on tasks within group_a.
task_load_joined_data depends on task_join_data.
Configuration
List any configuration settings or parameters used in the DAG.

Database Connection: postgres_conn
Weather API Connection: weathermap_api
Notes
Include any additional notes or considerations for running or maintaining the DAG.

Ensure the appropriate credentials are set up for PostgreSQL and the weather API.
Check the S3 bucket and file paths for saving and retrieving data.
Monitor DAG runs for any issues or failures.
Conclusion
Provide a conclusion or summary of the DAG's purpose and functionality.
